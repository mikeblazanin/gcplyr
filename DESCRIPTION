Description: Easy import, manipulation, and model-free analysis of
    bacterial growth curve data, as commonly output by plate readers.
    Tools for reshaping common plate reader outputs into 'tidy' formats and
    merging them with design information, making data easy to work with using 
    'gcplyr' and other packages. Also streamlines common growth curve
    processing steps, like smoothing and calculating derivatives, and
    facilitates model-free characterization and analysis of growth data.
