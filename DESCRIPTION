Description: This is a package containing functions for use in importing, 
    reshaping, processing, and analyzing growth curves data as output by plate 
    readers. This package can handle importing data that is block-shaped as well 
    as data that is "wide" shaped (where each column corresponds to a single 
    well in the plate). It reshapes such data into a consistent format, which 
    can then be processed and analyzed using the functions provided. This 
    package also contains functions enabling the association of experimental 
    design factors with the imported data, for ease of downstream analysis.
