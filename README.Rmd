<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

<!--
You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots in R chunks. In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "man/figures/README-",
  out.width = "100%"
)
```

# gcplyr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of gcplyr is to facilitate manipulation and analysis of growth curves data.

## What this package can do

* Growth curves data is commonly generated by plate readers, which export the data in a number of different formats. `gcplyr` can flexibly import all the common formats of measures data and reshape it for ease of downstream analysis
* The experimental design of a growth curves experiment might be saved in a tabular file (e.g. an Excel file), or may only exist non-digitally (e.g. in a lab notebook). `gcplyr` can import experimental designs from files or allow users to input that information directly through `gcplyr` functions. Then, `gcplyr` can merge experimental design elements with the measures data
* Combined measures and designs can be processed (e.g. smoothing) and analyzed using a variety of `gcplyr` functions

## Installation

You can install gcplyr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mikeblazanin/gcplyr")
```

## Getting Started

The best way to get started is to check out the `gcplyr-workflow` vignette, which included examples of all of the most common `gcplyr` functions and walks through how to import, manipulate, and analyze growth curves data using `gcplyr` from start to finish.

After installing `gcplyr` (instructions above), run:

``` r
vignette("gcplyr-workflow")
```
