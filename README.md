You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots in R chunks. In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

# gcplyr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of gcplyr is to facilitate manipulation and analysis of
bacterial growth curves data.

gcplyr is currently in an **Open Beta release**. Most features are
complete and should be relatively stable. Documentation should be
complete.

**Please send all questions, requests, comments, and bugs to
mikeblazanin \[at\] gmail \[dot\] com**

## What this package can do

- Bacterial density time series data is commonly generated by plate
  readers in a number of different formats. `gcplyr` can flexibly import
  all the common formats and reshape them for downstream analyses.
- Information on the experimental design elements of a set of growth
  curves might be saved in a tabular file (e.g. an Excel file), or may
  only exist non-digitally (e.g. in a lab notebook). `gcplyr` can import
  experimental designs from files or allow users to input that
  information directly through `gcplyr` functions. Then, `gcplyr` can
  merge these design elements with the density data imported from files.
- Growth curves datasets can be processed (e.g. smoothing) and analyzed
  using a variety of `gcplyr` functions

## Installation

You can install gcplyr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) by running the
following lines in R:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mikeblazanin/gcplyr")
```

## Getting Started

The best way to get started is to check out the `gcplyr-workflow`
vignette, which includes examples of all of the most common `gcplyr`
functions and walks through how to import, manipulate, and analyze
growth curves data using `gcplyr` from start to finish.

You can [access a pdf of the workflow vignette
here](./vignettes/gcplyr-workflow.pdf "gcplyr workflow vignette")

Or, after installing `gcplyr`, run:

``` r
vignette("gcplyr-workflow")
```
