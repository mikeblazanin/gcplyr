## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* There are not yet any published works describing the methods in this package. When there are they will be added to the description field of the DESCRIPTION file. In the meantime, I have added a link to the github repo where documentation is available for the methods.

* I added \value for all exported methods (only make_tidydesign was missing one)

* Cut the build time for vignettes in half

In previous resubmission (v1.0.0), I had:

* Replaced all directed quotes in DESCRIPTION with undirected quotes

* Changed links in README to be absolute

Note that there is currently no doi or arXiv paper out to be added to the package DESCRIPTION. One is in-prep and once available will be added to the DESCRIPTION and the package re-released.

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs

There were 2 NOTEs:

* This is a new submission to CRAN

* gcplyr is the name of the package and not misspelled

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package
