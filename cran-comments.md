## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Cut the build time for vignettes in half

In previous resubmission (v1.0.0), I had:

* Replaced all directed quotes in DESCRIPTION with undirected quotes

* Changed links in README to be absolute

Note that there is currently no doi or arXiv paper out to be added to the package DESCRIPTION. One is in-prep and once available will be added to the DESCRIPTION and the package re-released.

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs

There were 2 NOTEs:

* This is a new submission to CRAN

* gcplyr is the name of the package and not misspelled

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package
