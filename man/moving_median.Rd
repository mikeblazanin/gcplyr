\usage{
moving_median(
  formula,
  data,
  window_width_n = NULL,
  window_width = NULL,
  na.rm = TRUE,
  warn_nonnumeric_sort = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{Formula specifying the numeric response (density) 
and numeric predictor (time).}

\item{data}{Dataframe containing variables in \code{formula}}

\item{window_width_n}{Number of data points wide the moving median window is
(therefore, must be an odd number of points)}

\item{window_width}{Width of the moving median window (in units of \code{x})|}

\item{na.rm}{logical whether NA's should be removed before analyzing}

\item{warn_nonnumeric_sort}{logical whether warning should be issued when 
predictor variable that data is sorted by is 
non-numeric.}
}
\value{
Vector of smoothed data, with NA's appended at both ends
}
\description{
This function uses a moving median to smooth data
}
