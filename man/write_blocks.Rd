\usage{
write_blocks(
  blocks,
  file = NULL,
  output_format = "multiple",
  block_name_location = "filename",
  paste_sep = "_",
  filename_sep = "_",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{blocks}{list of block-shaped data to be written to file}

\item{file}{The filename or filenames. 

            Required when: \code{output_format = "single"}
            
            Optional when:
            \code{block_name_location = "filename"}
            
            and
            
            \code{output_format = "pasted"} or \code{output_format = "multiple"}}

\item{output_format}{One of "single", "pasted", "multiple".

                     "single" will write all blocks into a single
                     csv file, with an empty row between successive
                     blocks
                     
                     "pasted" will paste all blocks together using a
                     \code{paste_sep}, and then write that now-pasted
                     block to a single csv file
                     
                     "multiple" will write each block to its own csv file}

\item{block_name_location}{Either 'filename' or 'file'.

                          If 'filename', the \code{block_name} metadata 
                          will be used as the output file name(s) when
                          no file name(s) are provided, or appended to
                          file name(s) when they have been provided.
                          
                          If 'file', the \code{block_name} metadata will be
                          included as a row in the output file.}

\item{paste_sep}{When \code{output_format = 'pasted'}, what character
will be used to paste together blocks.}

\item{filename_sep}{What character will be used to paste together 
filenames when block_name_location = 'filename'.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to \code{write.csv}}
}
\value{
Nothing, but R objects are written to files
}
\description{
This function writes block-shaped lists (as created by
\code{read_blocks} or \code{make_design}) to csv files, including
both \code{data} and \code{metadata} in a variety of output formats
}
