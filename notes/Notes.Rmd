#Force-installing new version to re-build vignette & check tests
R CMD build --no-build-vignettes
R CMD check --no-build-vignettes --no-tests
(run R CMD check --help for more options)
Alternatively:
  install current version with devtools::install() or Ctrl+Shift+B
  OR devtools::build_rmd("vignettes/my-vignette.Rmd")
  
#Old approach
R CMD build gcplyr
R CMD check gcplyr_X.X.X.tar.gz
R CMD INSTALL gcplyr_X.X.X.tar.gz

#Every new version
1. Save & commit all changes to code
2. Run checks:
      devtools::check()
      rhub::rhub_check(branch = "develop") [choose 1,2,3,4]
      devtools::check_win_devel()
3. Organize, edit, and proofread NEWS.md. Commit.
4. Decide new version number, update DESCRIPTION version (dropping .9000) and date, commit
5. devtools::install()
6. Re-build vignettes (see code in vignette to re-build all formats at once). Commit
7. Re-knit README.Rmd and index.Rmd. Save & commit newly generated README.md files
      in bash: git commit -m "commit msg here" --no-verify
8. Push
9. git checkout master
10. git merge develop
11. git push
12. git checkout develop
13. Update DESCRIPTION to development version number (add .9000 at end of previous version)
14. Add header to NEWS.md for development version number
15. Add release on GitHub

#Releasing to CRAN
1. run process above, make sure you're back on master branch
2. edit cran-comments.md
3. devtools::release(args = "--compact-vignettes=gs+qpdf")

#Managing master & develop branches:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39478482/how-to-create-development-branch-from-master-on-github

## Creating a git develop branch
You can list all of your current branches like this:

```{bash}
git branch -a
```

This shows all of the local and remote branches. Assuming you only have a single master branch, you'd see the following:

```{bash}
* master
  remotes/origin/master
```
The * means the current branch.

To create a new branch named develop, use the following command:

```{bash}
git checkout -b develop
```

The -b flag creates the branch. Listing the branches now should show:

```{bash}
* develop
  master
  remotes/origin/master
```

## Changing branches
You shouldn't commit anything directly to the master branch. Instead do all your work on the develop branch and then merge develop into master whenever you have a new public release.

You are already in your develop branch, but if you weren't, the way to switch is as follows:

```{bash}
git checkout develop
```

That's the same way you create a branch but without the -b.

## Making changes on develop
When making changes, add and commit as usual:

```{bash}
git add .
git commit -m "whatever"
```

The first time you push to your remote do it like so:

```{bash}
git push -u origin develop
```

The -u flag stands for --set-upstream. After the first time you only need to do it like this:

```{bash}
git push
```

## Merging develop to master
Once your develop is ready to merge into master you can do it like so:

First switch to your local master branch:

```{bash}
git checkout master
```

To merge develop into master do the following:

```{bash}
git merge develop
```

Then push the changes in local master to the remote master:

```{bash}
git push
```

Done.

## Deleting a branch
If you don't need the develop branch anymore, or you just want to delete it and start over, you can do the following:

Delete the remote develop branch:

```{bash}
git push -d origin develop
```

Then delete the local branch:

```{bash}
git branch -d develop
```

The -d means delete.
