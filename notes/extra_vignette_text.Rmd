Additionally, some plate readers might output growth curve data in a block shape but in a single file. For instance, the file may contain the block from lines 1 - 8, then an empty line, then the next block from lines 10 - 17, etc. Since `read_blocks` is vectorized on most of its input arguments, including `startrow`, `startcol`, `endrow`, and `endcol`, such a layout can be specified by passing a vector of startrows and endrows to `read_blocks`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
imported_blockdata <- read_blocks(
  files = "example_file.csv",
  startrow = c(1, 10, 19, 28, 37, 46, 55),
  endrow = c(8, 17, 26, 35, 44, 53, 62))
```

Additionally, there are broadly two classes of growth curves-related information to be manipulated: numerical spectrophotometric data, and experimental design elements. If reading from files, `gcplyr` can read both classes of information, transform them, and merge them for subsequent analyses. `gcplyr` also contains the capability of specifying design elements programmatically, which can then be merged with imported spectrophotometric data.

Once spectrophotometric data and design elements have been combined, this merged measures-designs tidy-shaped dataframe can be used for subsequent pre-processing and analyses.



Note that `gcplyr` can handle multiple plates throughout this process, using lists which contain the corresponding single-plate data.frames as elements. Once design elements have been merged with these data.frames so that independent plates can be distinguished, multiple-plate lists can be collapsed together into a single tidy-shaped measures-designs dataframe using `merge_dfs`.
