Additionally, there are broadly two classes of growth curves-related information to be manipulated: numerical spectrophotometric data, and experimental design elements. If reading from files, `gcplyr` can read both classes of information, transform them, and merge them for subsequent analyses. `gcplyr` also contains the capability of specifying design elements programmatically, which can then be merged with imported spectrophotometric data.

Once spectrophotometric data and design elements have been combined, this merged measures-designs tidy-shaped dataframe can be used for subsequent pre-processing and analyses.



Note that `gcplyr` can handle multiple plates throughout this process, using lists which contain the corresponding single-plate data.frames as elements. Once design elements have been merged with these data.frames so that independent plates can be distinguished, multiple-plate lists can be collapsed together into a single tidy-shaped measures-designs dataframe using `merge_dfs`.
